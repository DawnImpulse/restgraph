### restgraph
> currently the project is in its infant stage and requires both testing & collaboration although early results are promising

#### Goal
To create a simple way to query only the required data from rest api without relying on lot of external tools or code.

> This project is inspired from GraphQl

But unlike graphql which is itself a whole new query language, **restgraph** aims to create a much simpler approach where you just write a simple special string which is used to parse and minify data

### Example
Suppose we have something like this
```
{
	"rest" : {
		"query: {
			"lang" : "",
			"map" : "",
			"name" : "",
			"age" : 2
		}
	}
}
```
Now if I just want 2 keys inside query, I can write a special map `{rest{query{lang,map}}}` which will return only the required data just like graphql
```
{
	"rest" : {
		"query: {
			"lang" : "",
			"map" : ""
		}
	}
}
```

#### Diving Deep
##### Generating the map
The map is generated by providing the required json object in the `createMap()` function. Basically the map is a simple json removing all double quotes and end values + replacing array with object notation i.e. you can treat it something really similar to **graphql queries** without extra spaces or anthing
	
##### Verifying the map
You can verify a map by using `verifyMap()` function

##### Parsing the data
Now to parse the data according to our requirement we can pass out map & original data directly to `mapData(map,data)` function which will return the expected output

#### How to use
> The goal is to make it as simple as possible for both frontend (mainly) and backend devs
- One of the way is to ask the client to send the map via header `restgraph` param (again completely upto you which way you want the map)
- Create a middleware function in your express, koa, hapi etc and wait for the normal response after which you can simply check for `restgraph` , verify the graph (if u want) & then send the `mapData` output
- You can also use it inside a single route, again completely upto you

#### Future
Right now the library is in its early stages and I want to test it thouroughly before recommending and putting it on npm. Also I planning to make simple libraries for other lang as well.
